    <h1>How to use OrbitalVis</h1>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    <p>OrbitalVis requires the a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be
      installed on your computer.  This release of OrbitalVis was
      developed with Java 1.7.0, update 65.  Later JRE's will probably
      work fine.  Earlier JRE's might also work but haven't been
      tested.  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle's
      latest JRE</a> is a free download, so this shouldn't pose a real
      problem.</p>
 
    <p>This code runs on Windows and Linux computers.</p>

    <h3>Installing OrbitalVis on your computer</h3>

    <p>Just unzip the downloaded zip file into a convenient directory
      of your choice.  Unzipping the zip file will create a new folder
      with all the OrbitalVis files in it.</p>

    <h2>Using OrbitalVis</h2>

    <h3>Selecting a reaction mechanism</h3>

    <p>You can select a reaction mechanism by editing the
      file <code>generic-props.txt</code> with a text editor (Notepad,
      for example).  In the part of that file marked "Which model?",
      you can remove the <code>#</code> character at the beginning of
      the line that indicates the model you want.  So, for example, if
      you want to see an E1 reaction, you change the line that looks
      like this:<br /><code>#model: E1</code><br />to 
      this:<br /><code>model: E1</code><br />Make sure that the lines
      for all the other models start with a <code>#</code>, and you're
      ready to run.
    </p>
    <p>If you want to see an S<sub><small>N</small></sub>2 reaction,
      just make sure that lines for all the other models start with
      a <code>#</code> character, and you're ready to go.
      (S<sub><small>N</small></sub>2 is the default, which is why
      there's no specific line for it.)</p>
    
    <p>Many other properties of the animation can also be changed by
      editing either the <code>generic-props.txt</code> file or the
      several mechanism-specific files (for
      example, <code>E1-props.txt</code> sets properties specific to the
      E1 animation).</p>

    <h3>Starting the program</h3>
 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Windows:</strong>
	Double-click <code>OrbitalVis.jar</code>.</li>
      <li><strong>Linux:</strong><ol>
	  <li>Open a terminal window.</li>
	  <li><code>cd</code> to the OrbitalVis-2016-10-03 directory
	    (wherever you put that).</li>
	  <li><code>java -jar OrbitalVis.java</code></li>
      </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Controls</h3>

    <h4>Running the reaction</h4>
 
    <p>The reaction can be run by using the arrow buttons at the top
      (press <strong>and hold</strong> to run the reaction forward or
      backward).  A specific point in the reaction can be chosen with
      the slider bar between the two arrow buttons.</p>
    
    <h4>Changing the viewpoint</h4>
    
    <p>The <code>Rock</code> button makes the model rock back and
      forth automatically.  This motion can be quite helpful in
      disambiguating the 3D structure, especially with more complex
      reactions.  Clicking the same button again (it will now be
      marked <code>Stop</code>) makes the rocking stop.</p>

    <p>The model can also be rotated about the vertical axis by
      clicking the mouse in the 3D window and dragging sideways.
      This can be useful if you want to look at a reaction from some
      particular angle.</p>
    <p>There is currently no way to rotate the model about either of
      the other two axes.</p>

    <h4>Attacking from the other side</h4>

    <p>If the reaction mechanism allows attack from the other side
      (such as E1 or S<sub><small>N</small></sub>1), the <samp>Attack
      other side</samp> button will restart the simulation with the
      attacking group coming from the other side.</p>

    <h4>Exiting the program</h4>
    
    <p>Closing the window exits the program. (For example, on Windows,
      click the little button with the &ldquo;X&rdquo; in the
      upper-right corner.)</p>
